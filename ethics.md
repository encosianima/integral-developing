##About Ethics:

The (re)search on what is good or bad is a key issue for the healthy development of human societies; the will to establish a common ethics can be seen in every culture. The topic is pretty vast and a way to tackle it could be starting from its etymology, which points to the word Ethos, which holds, in ancient Greek, two different meanings:

* éthos as the **Habits** acquired, referring to a set of **Actions** and it leads to set up laws or norms to filter actions as being good or bad. That's the Doing realm.

* êthos as the intrinsic **Characters** of each one referring directly to good or bad of people's **Attitudes** not related to actions or doing but related to the Being realm. 

When translating the concept to Latin, the term used was *mos* corresponding to *éthos* more than *êthos* and its meaning, a new term was coined by Cicero ("De Fato," II.i) *Morale* from which *Moral* derives, substituting together with Ethica, from which *Ethics* derives. Nevertheless, we find *éthos* and *êthos* equally represented in Quintiliano, for example, following Aristotelic tradition in which Habits are developed through acting and a person's character is therefore the structure of habits formed by what that person does.

From that fork two different terms were born, with the main difference between *Moral* and *Ethics* being the latter a reflection on the shared norms represented by Moral. The widespread use of Laws and Codes in subsequent moral systems, both religious and secular, focused on prescribing  **Actions**, failing to consider the field of **Attitudes** which Ethics implies directly.

Our point here is to stress the importance given to working on the **Attitudes** from the ancient Greeks to the present day aware that **Actions** may have a secondary role, as an off-chance, especially if they're expected to work as standalone.
What Heidegger called it *Da-sein* in XX century,

Further development of the concept of **Attitude** can lead to see them as of two types*: The Quantitative looking and the Qualitative looking.

* The Quantitative point of view prioritizes quantity, related to Attitudes such as to Have or to Achieve, to win and dominate. It's motivated by the personal interest and ambition is one of the outcomes produced: 'others' became competitors,  the main goal becomes Success.

* The Qualitative point of view prioritizes quality, represented by Attitudes such as to Be or to Learn, to give and receive. It's motivated by shared Values and generates high aspirations: 'others' became fellow travellers, the main goal is a Fair life.

Some authors observed that when Success is functional to shared Values (quality over quantity), then the Attitude,  actions and result (Success) benefit the most. The trick is giving priority to shared Values over personal Success, seen as an accessory secondary goal. 

It's a different case when qualitative is functional to quantitative  ( personal Success over  Shared Values), both attitude and acts (selfish).

Perhaps Values can hardly be taught or imposed: it's more likely they spread when interacting with humans and spaces committed to clear shared Values.

The best attitude is therefore giving priority to Values over quantity or success, just helpful secondary goal. Perhaps Values can hardly be taught or imposed: it's more likely they spread when interacting with humans and spaces committed to clear Values.

The Attitude of quality over quantity based on Values is what produces Commitment; committed people tend to carry out tasks with dedication. Instead, when good or bad is referred to actions ruled by law, or codes of conduct explicitly or implicitly agreed by large or small groups, the Attitude becomes Accomplishing (Fulfilling) degeneration from Ethics.

A further degeneration is caused by assuming personal ethics based on self-ish and subsequent moral code.
