##About Ethics:

The (re)search on what is good or bad for healthy development of human society is a key issue we found in cultures, focused on building common ethics. The topic is pretty vast and a way to it could be starting from its etymology, which points to the word Ethos, which holds, in ancient Greek, two different meanings:

* éthos as the **Habits** acquired, referring to a set of Actions and it leads to set up laws or norms to filter actions as being good or bad. That's the Doing realm.

* êthos as the intrinsic **Characters** of each one referring directly to good or bad of people's Attitudes not related to actions or doing but related to the Being realm. 

When translating the concept to Latin, the term used was *mos* corresponding to *éthos* more than *êthos* and its meaning, which importance was strongly defended by Aristotle, amongst others, though we find *éthos* and *êthos* equally represented in Quintiliano, for example. Nevertheless, a new term was coined by Cicero ("De Fato," II.i) *Morale* from which *Moral* derives, substituting together with Ethica, from which *Ethics* derives.
 
That fork gave birth to subsequent moral systems, both religious and secular, focused on the Actions, through the use of Laws and Codes omitting to consider the Attitudes of Being, which the Ethics field implies directly. In fact, the main difference between Moral and Ethics resides on being the latter a reflection on shared norms represented by moral systems.   

Our point here is to stress the importance given to working on the Attitudes from the ancient Greeks to the present day (Heidegger called it *Da-sein* in XX century), aware that Actions have a secondary role, as an off-chance.

Further development of this concept can lead to separated two *Attitude types*: The Quantitative looking and the Qualitative looking.

* The Quantitative point of view prioritizes quantity related to Attitudes such as to Have or to Achieve, to win and dominate. It's motivated by the personal interest and ambition is one of the outcomes produced: 'others' became competitors,  the main goal is Success.

* The Qualitative point of view prioritizes quality, represented by Attitudes such as to Be or to Learn, to give and receive. It's motivated by shared Values and generates high aspirations: 'others' became fellow travellers, the main goal is a Fair life.

Some authors observed that when Success is functional to shared Values (quality over quantity), then the Attitude,  actions and result (Success) benefit the most. The trick is giving priority to shared Values over personal Success, seen as an accessory secondary goal. 

It's a different case when qualitative is functional to quantitative  ( personal Success over  Shared Values), both attitude and acts (selfish).

Perhaps Values can hardly be taught or imposed: it's more likely they spread when interacting with humans and spaces committed to clear shared Values.

The best attitude is therefore giving priority to Values over quantity or success, just helpful secondary goal. Perhaps Values can hardly be taught or imposed: it's more likely they spread when interacting with humans and spaces committed to clear Values.

The Attitude of quality over quantity based on Values is what produces Commitment; committed people tend to carry out tasks with dedication. Instead, when good or bad is referred to actions ruled by law, or codes of conduct explicitly or implicitly agreed by large or small groups, the Attitude becomes Accomplishing (Fulfilling) degeneration from Ethics.

A further degeneration is caused by assuming personal ethics based on self-ish and subsequent moral code.
