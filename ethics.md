##About Ethics:

The re(search) on what is good or bad for the healthy development of human society is a key issue in all cultures, focused on building common ethics. The topic is pretty vaste and a way to it could be starting from its etimology, which points to the word Ethos, which holds,in ancient Greeck, two different meanings:

* éthos as the **Habits** adquired, referring to a set of Actions and it leads to set up laws or norms to filter actions as being good or bad. That's the Doing realm.

* êthos as the intrinsic **Caracters** of each one referring directly to good or bad of people's Attitudes not related to actions or doing but related to the Being realm. 

When translating concept to latin, the term used was **mos** corresponding to **éthos** more than **êthos** and its meaning, which importance was strongly defended by Aristotle, amongs others, though we find **éthos** and **êthos** equally represented in Quintiliano, for example.
 
It's certainly true that many subsequent moral systems, both religious and secular, focused on the Actions, thus using Laws and codes omitting to consider the Attitudes of Being. On the other hand, 
main difference between Ethics and Moral redides on the fact  what Heidegger called *Da-sein* in XX century

The example of two terms makes us understood the importance given to working on the Attitudes from ancient Greece and beyond,  where acts depend on them, while the ruling of Actions was given a secondary role, as an off-chance just in case anything else fails.

Furtherly, even if with some different shades amongst authors, ancient greeks' concept of the Attitudes separated two points of view or Attitude types: The Quantitative looking and the Qualitative looking.

* The Quantitative point of view prioritizes quantity, to Have or to Achieve, to win and dominate. It's motivated by the Interest and ambition is the outcome produced, the 'others' became competitors and the main goal is Success.

* The Qualitative point of view prioritizes quality, to Be or to Learn, to give and receive. It's motivated by Values and generates high aspirations , the 'others' became fellow travellers and the main goal is a Ideal life.

These authors observed that when the Success is functional to Values (quality over quantity), then the attitude is good for the whole society development (both actions and success benefit many others). While when the qualitative looking is functional to quantitative looking (the Success over the Values), both attitude and acts (selfish) render decadency and involution in the society.

The best attitude is therefore when the priority is given to Values and the quantity or success is a helpful secondary goal. Values cannot be taught to others, they are just rubbed off (caught by, 'infected') when interacting with humans and spaces committed to clear Values.

The Attitude of quality over quantity based on Values is what produces Commitment; committed people tend to carry out tasks with dedication. Instead, in the actual neoliberal individualized decadent society, the good or bad is most referred to actions ruled by law, and the Attitude becomes Accomplishing (Fulfilling).
