<i>Building a constructive attitude, and tools for a better world</i>

&nbsp;

This repository was originally created to develop collectively an approach to *Living as a whole* as integral's part of title represents, with the goal, amongst other, to explore  <a href="https://github.com/IntegralDevs/integral-developing/blob/master/ethics.md">Ethics</a> as a set of principles and also its practical applications in many fields. Besides, this repository was also an attempt to sum-up and therefore join forces between like-minded persons in a common effort for the common good. That is still a process whose premises are a toolkit made up of experiences, tests and trials.

It's part of a more extended project inside Health and Integral Development, a non-profit association devoted to promoting human well-being at all levels, to collectively identify tools and tactics in an attempt to improve life in each of the aspects that affect its quality.

We aim to develop different projects to pursue the common good under the flag of **open source philosophy**, thus promoting what we named art attitudes such as the pleasure of doing, sharing and collaborating and other open-source practice commons to both the hacker  and activism movement in their genuine essence. 

**Integral** means that between the holistic approach implied in the concept of integral revolution and the world-inclusive approach of the [integral-theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_theory_(Ken_Wilber)) we propose Integral as a Conceptual Framework in which to develop politics and tools to foster "common" ethical values.
Research on those common ethical values and how to implement them is an ongoing process.

In order to build up a healthy team to work on goals as explained above, we set up the following points as the current results of an organic and always open collective process of improving and broadening them:

Art as an attitude in front of any task. An attitude is artistic when it makes doers enjoy and improve any action: All verbs are Arts! This way, enjoying-improving each one of the tasks we perform enhances the level of quality of both experiences and whatever is the outcomes of that action.

We took seriously the fact that personal evolution is mandatory to evolve collectively as a species; from an ego-centric to a world-centric point of view. We also believe is necessary to keep our inner source of love open to avoid falling into the endless quest for love outside of ourselves!

The practice of open source, in addition to establishing a model of collaboration and commitment, means choosing a mindset whose foundations are openness, attribution and comprehensive references to meet the conditions of coherence and facilitate a set of tools to work with rather than pre-packaged ideas.
