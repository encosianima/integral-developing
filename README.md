<i>Building a constructive attitude, and tools for a better world</i>

&nbsp;

This repository was created to develop collectively an integral approach to *Living as a whole*, with the goal, amongst other, to explore  <a href="https://github.com/IntegralDevs/integral-developing/blob/master/ethics.md">Ethics</a> as a set of principles and also its practical applications in many fields.

Besides, this repository was also an attempt to sum-up and therefore join forces between like-minded persons in a common effort for the common good. That is still a process whose premises are a toolkit made up of experiences, tests and trials.
