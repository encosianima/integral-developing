<i>Building a constructive attitude, and tools for a better world</i>

&nbsp;

This repository was originally created to develop collectively an approach to *Living as a whole* as integral's part of title represents, with the goal, amongst other, to explore  <a href="https://github.com/IntegralDevs/integral-developing/blob/master/ethics.md">Ethics</a> , [Art] and other topics as a set of principles and also its practical applications in many fields. Besides, this repository was also an attempt to sum-up and therefore join forces between like-minded persons in a common effort for the common good. That is still a process whose premises are a toolkit made up of experiences, tests and trials.

Integral Developping is part of a more extended project inside Health and Integral Development, a non-profit association devoted to promoting human well-being at all levels, to collectively identify tools and tactics in an attempt to improve life in each of the aspects that affect its quality.

We aim to pursue the common good under the flag of **open source philosophy**, thus promoting **development** what we named *art attitude* such as the pleasure of doing, sharing and collaborating and other open-source practice in their genuine essence. 

The term **Integral** has a broad meaning, it draws attention on the holistic approach so we propose Integral as a Conceptual Framework in which to develop politics and tools to foster "common" ethical values.
Research on those common ethical values and how to implement them is an ongoing process.

In order to build up a healthy team to work on goals as explained above, we set up the [following points]() as the current results of an organic and always open collective process of improving and broadening them
