## What is Art? ## 

This is a work in progress on a matter rised [here](https://sebastiafreixa.com/en/the-arts-of-living/)

I myself had a go on art matter defining Aestethics [here](https://www.valentinamesseri.eu/wordpress/2015/04/06/aesthetics-in-a-nutshell/) a further work in progress which I barely adress the issue.[1](https://iep.utm.edu/aestheti/#H6)

The modern English word **art** (a noun, an adjective and a verb at the same time) comes from the the Latin artem, the Old English eart, the Middle English art. In romance languages. 
In our western culture at least, ”What is art?” aka “How do we determine what is defined as art?” could be split into two: the essential nature of art, and its social importance (or lack of it). 

in Aesthetics, namely the philosophy of art, definition of art has generally fallen into three categories:

   * Art as Representation or Mimesis. 
   * Art as Expression of Emotional Content. 
   * Art as Form.  

Beyond its definition, Aesthetic is strictly related to Ethic, the two participated equally in Axiology, The theory of Value, I briefly discussed [here](https://www.valentinamesseri.eu/wordpress/2016/09/24/theory-of-values-in-a-nutshell/).

All things above must be considered as preambles for a topic I'll attempt to develop here. 

Stay tuned!
