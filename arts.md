## What is Art? ## 

A matter rised [here](https://sebastiafreixa.com/en/the-arts-of-living/)

I had a go on art matter defining Aestethics [here](https://www.valentinamesseri.eu/wordpress/2015/04/06/aesthetics-in-a-nutshell/) a work in progress which barely adress the issue.

The modern English word **art** (a noun, an adjective and a verb at the same time) comes from the the Latin artem, the Old English eart, the Middle English art. In romance languages . In our western culture at least, ”What is art?” aka “How do we determine what is defined as art?” could be split into two: the essential nature of art, and its social importance (or lack of it). 

in Aesthetics, the philosophy of art, definition of art has generally fallen into three categories: representation, expression, and form:

   * Art as Representation or Mimesis. 
   * Art as Expression of Emotional Content. 
   * Art as Form.  

Today, all three modes of definition come into play in determining what is art, and its value, depending on the artwork being assessed.
