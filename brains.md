## About the Brain: ##

The following is intended to be a reflection on a brain-related topic suggested [here](https://sebastiafreixa.com/en/developing-minds/)

Brain is subject that has, understandably, captivated human beings for centuries, although it was through contemporary technique, such as a [Neuroimaging](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroimaging)

Damasio, in his 1995 essay [Descartes' Error: Emotion, Reason, and the Human Brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Descartes%27_Error), shows how the "mechanistic" cultural tradition intruduced during moder age by phisicians such as Galeano, following Descartes'dualism. has always devalued emotions while they are at the basis of the good functioning of the mind. In simple terms, without emotional capacity he it won't be able to be reasonable. 
Damasio highlights the mutual action of body and brain, which constitute a unique and inseparable organism.  Reason could not function properly without emotions, that is, without the close connection with the body, which constantly offers the basic material with which the brain constructs the images from which thought originates. 

The new theory of the interconnection between the emotional world and rationality refutes the scientific tradition that confines emotions to the oldest and least evolved subcortical centres and therefore neglects their connection with thought. Emotions take on a cognitive dimensions.
